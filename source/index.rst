Welcome to ImPS's documentation!
================================

ImPS is a simple one-file module wrapper to use WPF components in your script without writing massive amounts of UI code or using XML layouts. 
It is heavily inspired by ImGUI/DearPyGui to make it as easy as possible to use while keeping the configurability.
